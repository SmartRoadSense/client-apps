Generate tracks
===============
Store input as "stored tracks", using the same disk format used by the mobile clients.

Examples:

CliToolkit store --source file1 file2 file3 --length n --chunking m --output filename
Loads stored tracks, glues them together and writes out a set of chunked files (trimmed to n samples).

CliToolkit store --length n --chunking m --output filename
Generates n random data points, writes out a set of chunked files.

Upload tracks
=============
Loads stored tracks or generates data points, uploading them to the DEV API end point.
The secret (and results of the upload operation) can be stored to file.

Examples:

CliToolkit upload --source file1 file2 --chunking m
Loads stored tracks, glues them together and uploads them in chunks of m files.

Generate payload
================
Loads data and prepares an upload payload, without transmission.

Examples:

CliToolkit payload --source file1 file2 file3 --output filename
